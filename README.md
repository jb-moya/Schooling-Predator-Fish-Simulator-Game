## üéÆ Features

- **Dynamic Ecosystem Simulation**: Watch predator and prey fish interact in real-time.
- **Behavior Modeling**: Prey fish avoid predators, while predators hunt for survival.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust parameters like fish speed, prey field vision, toggle on/off behavior, and more.
- **Beautiful Graphics**: Simple but effective visuals with smooth animations.
